i) Tabular Dataset: NYC Taxi Trip Data
Dataset: NYC Taxi Trip Data

Steps:

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, incorrect data types (e.g., converting timestamps to datetime), duplicate rows, and normalize numerical columns if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions of trip durations, distances, fare amounts, and time-related features. Use scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, and time series visualizations.
Feature Engineering and Selection: Extract additional features from timestamps (day of the week, hour of the day), distance features from coordinates, etc. Drop or select features based on importance.
Clustering and Anomaly Detection: Use K-Means or DBSCAN for clustering and identify outliers using statistical methods or machine learning models.
Data Imputation: Use techniques like mean/mode imputation or predictive models for missing values.
Model Building: Use AutoML tools like Auto-ViML, build models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or ensemble methods for regression (predicting trip fare).
ii) Time-Series Dataset: Air Quality Prediction (Delhi)
Dataset: Air Quality Prediction (Delhi)

Steps:

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Handle missing values, check for stationarity, deal with seasonality or trends, and ensure correct time formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends over time, seasonality, and detect any anomalies in the data. Use line charts, time series decomposition, and seasonal decomposition.
Feature Engineering: Create time-based features (day, month, week), rolling averages, and lag features if needed.
Clustering and Anomaly Detection: Apply clustering algorithms and anomaly detection methods like Isolation Forest or Z-Score to identify unusual patterns or data points.
Data Imputation: Impute missing values using linear interpolation or predictive models.
Model Building: Build time-series forecasting models using AutoML (e.g., Auto-ViML, Prophet) and apply ensemble techniques.
